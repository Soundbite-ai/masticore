# Masticore
A "core" library for .Net Core web apps

Named for [Masticore](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Masticore), a card from [Magic: The Gathering](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Urza%27s_Destiny). A card so good it was used by everyone. Its expansion was also notably announced the same year [Erik Ralston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikralston/), co-founder of [Soundbite.AI](https://soundbite.ai/) and original author of Masticore, made their first website.

This broad structure and some capabilities in this library are based on the [.Net 4.6 Version of the Masticore Library](https://github.com/eralston/Masticore) originally  created to benefit rapid prototypes of side projects in ASP.Net MVC, eventually finding a lot of use at [LiveTiles](https://livetilesglobal.com/), and going on to form the foundation for this .Net Core rewrite and expansion that accelerated implementation of [Soundbite.AI](https://soundbite.ai/).
